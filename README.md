# Role-and-user-permission-control
The most basic authority control for roles and users. Many-to-many mapping is directed to the management authority table, user table and role table. The framework is still springboot without using spring sercurity. 最基础的针对角色和用户的权限控制。多对多映射针对管权限表，用户表和角色表。框架依旧还是springboot而没有用springsecurity。
